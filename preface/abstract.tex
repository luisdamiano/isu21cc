\specialchapt{ABSTRACT}

Yield monitor datasets are known to contain a high percentage of
unreliable records. The current tool set is mostly limited to
observation cleaning procedures based on heuristic or
empirically-motivated statistical rules for extreme value
identification and removal. We propose a constructive algorithm for
processing well-documented yield monitor data artifacts without the
need to throw observations. The RITAS algorithm models sample
observations as overlapping, irregularly-sized and time-ordered
spatial units to better replicate the nature of the destructive
sampling process. Smoothing via a Gaussian Process is used to provide
map users with spatial-trend visualization. The intermediate steps as
well as the algorithm output are illustrated in grain yield maps for
an agricultural site.
